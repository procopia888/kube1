Hello, I'm Valentin Flora, with five years of experience as an AWS engineer. My journey began in 2017 when I joined Infosys. Initially, I supported .NET applications during my first year there. After that, I transitioned to supporting AWS, starting with monitoring resources such as Kubernetes and EC2 using CloudWatch. As I progressed, I received further training in AWS technologies. I then became involved in CICD projects, where I created pipelines using CodeCommit for code repository, CodeBuild for testing and building applications, and CodeDeploy for deploying to ECS Fargate. Subsequently, I delved into Kubernetes, learning to deploy pods, nodes, and services by studying relevant documentation. Additionally, I participated in a project where I utilized Terraform to create resources.
